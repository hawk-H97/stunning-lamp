OpenAI Models
- OpenAI is a research company focused on artificial intelligence (AI). They are praticularly well-known for their 
development of large language models (LLMs).

LLMS?
- LLM is a fancy way of saying a computer program that's really good with language. Just like you learn a language by 
reading and listenting a lot, these programs are trained on massive amounts of text to understand and even create 
human language!

Diffrence between Generative AI vs LLMS

Generative AI 
- This is a broad term for any AI that can create new things, like art, music, text or even code. It's like a big 
toolbox with many different creative AI tools.

LLMs 
- These are a specific type of Generative AI that focus on creating and understanding human lanugage. They're like a
really powerful tool in the generative AI toolbox, specialized for working with words.

Tokens ?
- When we provide prompts to OpenAI models, they become tokens. Tokens are like tiny pieces of text that OpenAI uses 
to understand and process information. They can be individual words, parts of words, or even specical characters.

Money 
- OpenAI uses tokens as the unit for billing their services. That means you get charged based on the total number of
tokens used in your request & the response you got in return.
